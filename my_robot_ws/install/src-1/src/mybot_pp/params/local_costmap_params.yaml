# The "global_frame", "robot_base_frame", "update_frequency", and "static_map" parameters are the same as in the Global_Config.
# The "publish_frequency" parameter determines the rate, in Hz, at which the costmap will publish visualization information. 
# Setting the "rolling_window" parameter to true means that the costmap will remain centered around the robot as the robot moves 
# through the world. 
# The "width," "height," and "resolution" parameters set the width (meters), height (meters), and resolution (meters/cell) of the 
# costmap. Note that its fine for the resolution of this grid to be different than the resolution of your static map, 
# but most of the time we tend to set them equally.
